# **Storage Layouts**

## **Solidity Storage**

Stores data in contracts using a numeric address space. 

- The first state variable is stored at position 0
- The next state variable is stored at position 1
- The next state variable is stored at position 2, etc.

### Solidity Default Layout

- A **function signature** is the **name of a function** and its **parameter types**.
    - Ex.Â `myfunction(uint256)`
    - *A limitation is that two external functions with the same function signature canâ€™t be added to the same diamond at the same time*
- **Facets** of a diamond **share** the same storage **address space** because they have the **same diamond** and **facets only read and write state variables in diamonds**
    - ***Problem***:
        - ***Diamond has two facets***
            - **FacetA** and **FacetB**
            - **FacetA** **declares** state variables **â€˜uint first;â€™** and **â€˜bytes32 second;â€™**
            - **FacetB** **declares** state variables **â€˜uint first;â€™** and **â€˜string name;â€™.**
        - **Both facets are storing `uint first` at position 0, both facets read and write that variable without problem.**
        - **Both facets are writing and reading different variables at position 1 â€” â€˜bytes32 secondâ€™ and â€˜string nameâ€™.**

## **Diamond Storage**

- Unlike Solidity storage layout, Diamond storage allows you to choose the address space
- Facets specify different locations to start storing data, preventing different facets with different state variables from clashing storage locations.
- This is what **Diamond Storage** does -
    - **Hash of unique string gets random storage position to store a struct**
        - struct contains all of the state variables
        - â€˜unique stringâ€™ acts as a namespace for particular functionality
    - ***example*:** ***ERC721Facet** implementation*
        - Facet stores a struct called â€˜ERC721Storageâ€™ at position *â€˜keccak256("com.myproject.erc721");â€™.*
        - struct could contain all the state variables related to ERC721
            - ERC721Facet reads/writes and nothing else

### **Advantages**

- ERC721Facet is reusable.
- ERC721Facet not cluttered with declarations of variables it does not use

## **App Storage**

- **AppStorage enforces a naming/access convention *makes code more readable and prevents name clashes* of state variables.**
    - The AppStorage struct contains state variables that will be shared between facets.
        - To use it a facet imports the AppStorage struct and declares `AppStorage internal s;` as the Facets first state variable
        - The facet then accesses all state variables in functions via the struct like this: `s.myFirstVariable`, `s.mySecondVariable`
- *â€˜AppStorage internal s;â€™* should be declared as the first state variable in all facets using it
    - position 0 in the storage address space allowing storage data to line up between facets
- Add more state variables to the end of the AppStorage struct or use Diamond Storage to avoid address clashing
    - AppStorage can be used with Diamond Storage in the same facet
