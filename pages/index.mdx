# ðŸ’Ž Diamonds ðŸ’Ž 

### [**EIP 2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)

## **Overview**
In Feb â€˜20 Nick Mudge created the Diamond EIP, it was finalized in Oct â€˜22. 
This proposal standardizes diamonds, which are modular smart contract systems that can be upgraded/extended after deployment, and have virtually no size limit. 

## **What?**

- A diamond is a smart contract, the address of the Diamond is used for software to interact with it.
- Internally a diamond uses a set of contracts called facets for its external functions.
- All state variable storage data is stored in a diamond, not in its facets.
- A facet is a contract whose external functions are added to a diamond for functionality.
- The external functions of facets can directly read and write data stored in a diamond.
- A diamond implements a fallback function using `delegatecall`Â to route function calls to facets.

## **When?**

- You exceed the max size of a contract.
- You want to control complexity of multiple small contracts.
- You need or want greater control over when and what functions exist.
- Your development is incremental and your contracts will grow with your application.

## **Why?**

- Diamonds can be upgradeable or immutable.
- Diamonds overcome the maximum contract size limit of 24KB.
- Diamonds can be large but modular because they are compartmented with facets.
- Diamonds are optimized to save gas, state variables are shared between facets.
- Diamonds make it possible to add/replace/remove functions w/o needing to redeploy.
