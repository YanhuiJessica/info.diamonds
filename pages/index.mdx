### **EIP 2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy**

## **Why use a diamond?**

- You exceed the max size of a contract and functionality that needs to access same storage variables.
- Diamonds can be large but still modular because they are compartmented with facets.
- You want to control complexity of multiple small contracts.
- You need or want greater control over when and what functions exist.
- Your development is incremental and you want your contracts to grow with your application.

## **What is a diamond?**

- A diamond is a smart contract, the address of the Diamond is used for software to interact with it.
- Internally a diamond uses a set of contracts called facets for its external functions.
- All state variable storage data is stored in a diamond, not in its facets.
- A facet is a contract whose external functions are added to a diamond for functionality.
- The external functions of facets can directly read and write data stored in a diamond.
- A diamond implements a fallback function using `delegatecall` to route function calls to facets.

## **Diamond Benefits**

- Diamonds overcome the maximum contract size limit of 24KB.
- Facets can be deployed once and reused by any number of diamonds.
- Optimized to save gas because state variables are shared between facets.
- Diamonds can be upgradeable or immutable.
- Diamonds make it possible to add/replace/remove functions w/o needing to redeploy.
