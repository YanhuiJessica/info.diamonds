# **Proxies**
<aside>
**Diamond pattern** is similar to **multi-proxy pattern** which deploys **proxy and logic contracts.**

## **Transparent Proxy pattern**

- Proxy contract is what the user interacts with and holds the data
- Proxies are immutable but contain a [fallback function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/contracts.html#fallback-function)
- The fallback function catches function calls and uses `delegatecall` to forward to logic contract
- `delegatecall` allows the proxy contract to use functions on the logic contract
- When an external function is called on a diamond, the fallback function is executed
- The fallback function finds facet to call from function selector which provides first 4 bytes of call data 
- The function is then executed from the facet using `delegatecall`
- Diamond’s fallback function & `delegatecall`enable a diamond to execute a facet’s external functions.
- `msg.sender`&`msg.value`values do not change, only the diamond’s storage is read and written to.
- Logic contract stores functions, defined separate from data
- Logic contract address is defined in the proxy
- Proxy can redefine logic contract addresses, changing logic w/o impacting the underlying data
- Logic changes can be managed via governance or controlled via a multi-sig wallet

## **UUPS Proxy**

Proxy pattern allows upgradability for smart contracts, the drawback is the entire logic contract must be replaced to add/replace/remove functions from proxy contract.

## Multi-Facet Proxy (Diamond Pattern)

Multi-Facet Proxies provide granular control of functionality by allowing the Proxy to add/remove/replace functions without impacting other logic.
